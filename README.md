# Convolutional Neural Networks

**Author:** Miguel Carrasco Belmar  
Have you ever counted how many times you pick up your phone each day? It’s estimated that an average person unlocks their phone 110 to 150 times per day. Each time you unlock your phone using Face ID or facial recognition, you’re actually using a Convolutional Neural Network, over 100 times a day!

## What are Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of neural network widely used in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
A Neural Network is a machine learning system, specifically a form of Deep Learning, that uses layers of interconnected nodes (or “neurons”) to process data. These layers work together to detect patterns and make predictions — whether it’s recognizing speech, translating text, or classifying images.

Each neuron receives input, applies a mathematical function (like a weighted sum followed by an activation function), and passes the result forward to the next layer. During training, the network learns to adjust these weights so that its predictions get closer and closer to the correct outputs.
How do Neural Networks work?
Neural networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain — with artificial “neurons” that activate in response to input. A simple neural network consists of three main layers:
